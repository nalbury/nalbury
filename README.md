### nalbury 

Hey folks, welcome to my github. I'm nalbury (he/him), and I spend most of my work time trying to convince kubernetes to do stuff. In my free time, I try to avoid the keyboard and get away from the machines but occasionally I work on projects here for funsies. 

Generally speaking, I don't have a ton of time for maintaining these projects, but I try to add/fix stuff, respond to github issues, and review PRs when I can. 

Here's some links to other cool projects:
- https://github.com/lima-vm/lima
- https://github.com/kris-nova/naml
- https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo
- https://github.com/dagger/dagger

And here's a picture of my dog:
